# CrI2 and CrI3 Monolayer Monte Carlo Simulations for Magnetic Properties

This repository contains Fortran code for simulating the magnetic properties of CrI2 and CrI3 monolayers using Monte Carlo simulations. The main program `simulation.f90` reads atomic positions from an input file and determines their neighbors to calculate the magnetic properties.
